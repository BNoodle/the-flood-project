                        Anything and everything you donate to our cause goes straight to building homes, supplying food, or doing anything that helps people in Jakarta. Don't worry if you can't donate that much! Even one dollar is fine! Any support you can give us will be greatly appreciated.

                    <h2>Can't Donate?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Can't donate? Thats okay! There are plenty of other ways to support us. Like, coming to our events that we hold every month. Or, spreading our cause to other people, like friends and family. Or directly supporting Jakarta or somewhere near you that has flooding problems by taking action. There are so many things you can do and you are not limited by money!
