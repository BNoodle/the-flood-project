                    <h2>Why Did We Start This Project?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, is the worlds
                        fastest sinking city because of climate change and sea
                        levels rising, along with the fact that most of the
                        water they get is from pumping ground water. We need a
                        solution for this because currently, 40% of the city is
                        submerged in water. Floods are also very common. When
                        the rivers rise, bad floods can lead to destruction. In
                        2007, the worst flood happened. It put 70% of Jakarta
                        underwater, at least 76 people were killed, and over
                        half a million people were left homeless. What’s even
                        worse, is that these floods more affect the poorer
                        communities on the outskirts of the city and less
                        developed areas, so solving this can also help with
                        poverty. If we don’t do something about this soon, by
                        2050, Jakarta is predicted to be fully underwater, and
                        32 million people will be without a home.

                    <p>
                        Jakarta is not the only place being affected by sea
                        level rise or just climate change in general. Many
                        places around the world are being affected. Wherever you
                        live, there is probably some problem involved with
                        climate change. We intend to expand outside of Jakarta
                        in the future once we already have a good foundation in
                        Jakarta.

                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        We help people in need in Jakarta because of the
                        flooding there. As previously mentioned, Jakarta is
                        literally sinking, and floods are very common. This
                        leads to destruction of peoples homes, water, and food
                        shortages. Our goal is to help these people in need by
                        supplying them with food and water, as well as help
                        rebuild homes that have been damaged or destroyed. We
                        work with major food and water companies that supply us
                        with those things so we can give it to people in Jakarta
                        who need it. We also are working with a building company
                        and they come out and help us rebuild homes. Overall, we
                        are just trying to help people in need and get help to
                        people who need it.
